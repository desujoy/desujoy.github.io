# My Personal Portfolio Website

Trying to make a portfolio website

## Plans

- A preloader with linux boot sequence type something
    - maybe a preloader.js for all these

- navbar
    - home
    - about
    - projects
    - certifications
    - contact

- a dark/light mode toggle button
    - maybe light-mode.css and dark-mode.css
    - how to toggle between them? 
        - will add a function to toggle href of link tag

# Choosing options

- framework
    - bootstrap, materialize, tailwind, bulma, foundation, semantic ui, uikit, pure.css, spectre.css, milligram, skeleton, tachyons, chota, mini.css, picnic.css, water.css, w3.css, siimple, basscss, sakura, mil, 
    - I will go with bootstrap because it is the most popular and I have used it before
    - although the best would have been tailwind but I don't know it

- css preprocessor
    - sass, less, stylus, postcss
    - I will go with sass because I have used it before
